# Cute-Sync~

![](images/table cap.png?raw=true)

CuteSync is a small version of Milky's 4chan NameSync for /b/ and /soc/, designed for mobile devices.
It does not require 4chan X

## Notes~

Will update names on boards and in threads and on every auto update.
You can post with names, HOWEVER: the QR is not supported; you must use the old post form at the top of the page.
You can turn the QR off in the 4chan settings menu.

### Installing~

tl;dr i don't know, google it.
this will be way different with different devices and browsers.
I tested it in WebHub for iOS 7.
